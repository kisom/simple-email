# simple-email

`simple-email` is a Clojure wrapper around the Apache Commons Email.

Right now it only supports sending plaintext emails; in the future, it
may be extended to support HTML emails (but I hate HTML email so probably
not ;)).

## Usage

In `projects.clj` add `[simple-email "1.0.7"]` to the `:dependencies`.

```clojure
(use [simple-email.core])

(def mail-host "mail.dropsonde.net")
(def mail-port 587)
(def mail-user "pollard")
(def mail-pass "rickson")
(def mail-from "pollard@dropsonde.net")
(def mail-ssl true)

(def dropsonde-server
     (mail-server
          mail-host
          mail-port
          mail-ssl
          mail-user
          mail-pass
          mail-from))

(send-to dropsonde-server
         "boone@dropsonde.net" 
         "Witty Subject Line" 
         "Your email body goes here.")
{:ok true :message nil :cause nil}

(send-mail [ "pollard@dropsonde.net" "bigend@drosonde.net" ]
           "This is an email."
           "Further explanation goes here.")
{:ok true :message nil :cause nil}
```

The `mail-from` value can be in the form "user@domain" or "Joe User <user@domain>".

The `send-to` and `send-mail` forms are synchronous; the forms `send-to-async` and
`send-mail-async` will return an agent that can be queried for its status. The result
from the agent or the synchronous functions is a hash-map with the following keys:

* `:ok`: true if the mail was successfully sent or false if there was an exception
* `:message`: the message from the exception on error, nil on success
* `:cause`: the cause of the exception on error, nil on success

simple-email was inspired by [William Groppe's article](http://will.groppe.us/)
["Sending email from Clojure"](http://will.groppe.us/post/406065542/sending-email-from-clojure).

## Using environment variables to set up the mailserver
The form `mail-server-from-env` will use environment variables to determine
the appropriate information for the mailserver. The relevant environment 
variables are

```
MAIL_HOST
MAIL_PORT
MAIL_SSL
MAIL_USER
MAIL_PASS
MAIL_FROM
```

Alternatively, the variables may be prefixed and that prefix should be passed
to the `mail-server-from-env` form. For example, if the environment variables
are named `PREFIX_MAIL_HOST` etc..., you would call

```
(mail-server-from-env "PREFIX")
```
